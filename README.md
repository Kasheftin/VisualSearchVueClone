## Features

- Currently tested in chrome only.
- VisualSearch activates on mouse click, deactivates on external (window) click with correct event dismount on destroy.
- Dynamic input width based on this example, http://jsfiddle.net/4Qsa8/.
- Dynamic input width considers the dropdown width and goes to the next line if the last overflows.
- Full keyboard support in dropdown: up, down arrows, enter, tab and esc keys.
- Mouse overs and clicks work on dropdown list as well.
- Selecting the value from the list jumps to the next stage and allows to use next dropdown filter immediately.
- Simple component's change event listener implemented.
